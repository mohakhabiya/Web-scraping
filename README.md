# Web-scraping
Web scraping is the **automated process of extracting data from websites**. Instead of manually copying and pasting information, a script or tool—often written in Python using libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`—fetches the HTML content of a webpage and parses it to collect specific data points such as product names, prices, reviews, or stock availability.

In your attached notebook, for example, you scraped book titles, prices, availability, and image links from the "Books to Scrape" website. You used:
- `requests` to fetch the webpage content,
- `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML,
- and then extracted elements like `<h3>` for titles and `<p class="price_color">` for prices.

This technique is widely used in data science for tasks like:
- **Market research** (e.g., tracking competitor prices),
- **Sentiment analysis** (e.g., collecting reviews),
- **Academic research** (e.g., gathering structured datasets),
- and **machine learning** (e.g., building training datasets).
